# Gym Session Booking System

#### Requirements

- There are multiple centers in Bangalore. We can expand to multiple cities across and beyond India.
- Each center has n slots of an hour each. For eg the Bellandur center has only 6 slots - 3 in the morning of an hour each from 6 am to 9 am and similarly 3 in the evening from 6 pm to 9 pm. All the centers might/might not be open 7 days a week.
- Each slot at a center can have m possible workout variations - Weights, Cardio, Yoga, Swimming etc. There could be newer workouts added at center/slot level in the future.
- The number of seats in each workout at each time-slot for a given center is fixed.
- There can be two personas of the users, FK_VIP_USER, FK_NORMAL_USERS.
- VIP persona users will have access to premium slots while normal users will not be able to see premium slots. This use case will be extended in future with custom offerings for premium users and normal users. The pricing could be different for premium vs normal users,etcâ€¦ 
- A Person can book a maximum of 3 slots in a day for any center. User can have more slots across the centers
- It should be easy to change the underlying data storage mechanism as data scale increases without changing various parts of the application
- User can perform the following operations:
1. Register onto the platform
2. View the workouts availability/unavailability for a particular day at a center. VIP customers will have a different set of slots shown while normal customers will be shown different sets of slots. Eg: Early morning slots are dedicated only for the VIP customer. In the future, VIP customers might see different pricing for the same centers.(different pricing logic need not be implemented but code should be extensible for the same).
3. Book a workout for a user if seats are available in that time slot at that center
4. View his/her plan basis day as input
5. Cancel his/her workout and the slot should be accommodated by the immediate person in the queue and while filling the slot VIP customers should be given the priority. Once all the VIP customers in the queue are allocated then the normal customers are allocated.
